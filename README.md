# hello-world
This is a repository made for the first hello world tutorial.

Here I have to write a bit about myself, So here is a bit abut the word 'myself'. It consists out of the word my and self which both refer to oneself. So really you're just saying 'selfself'. Or if you see my as in 'your own' then you're saying you're 'yourOwnSelf'. If somebody else owns you I'd feel sorry for you.

Big love,
-Dread
